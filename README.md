Investigating Genetic and Biological Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease
Overview
This study aims to unravel the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder driven by multifaceted interactions between genetic, environmental, and molecular factors. By integrating multi-omics datasets and advanced computational approaches, this work seeks to identify critical gene networks and pathways associated with AD risk, progression, and pathological hallmarks. The findings aim to inform therapeutic strategies targeting disease-modifying mechanisms.
